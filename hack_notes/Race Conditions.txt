Step 1: Find Features Prone to Race Conditions
Attackers use race conditions to subvert access controls. In theory, any application whose sensitive actions rely on access-control mechanisms could be
vulnerable.

Step 2: Send Simultaneous Requests

Step 3: Check the Results

Step 4: Create a Proof of Concept

Finding Your First Race Condition!
Now youâ€™re ready to find your first race condition. Follow these steps to
manipulate web applications using this neat technique:
1. Spot the features prone to race conditions in the target application and
copy the corresponding requests.
2. Send multiple of these critical requests to the server simultaneously.
You should craft requests that should be allowed once but not allowed
multiple times.
3. Check the results to see if your attack has succeeded. And try to execute
the attack multiple times to maximize the chance of success.
4. Consider the impact of the race condition you just found.
5. Draft up your first race condition report!
