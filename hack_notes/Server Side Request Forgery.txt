Server Side Request Forgery
Impersonating server and make request on their behalf
Possible through signature forgery, this allows them
to presume a privileged position, bypass firewall 
controls and gain access to internal networks 

PREVENTION
Impl Allow / block list 

Hunting 
Review source code - how it validates user provided urls req params
Test end points with the potential to be prone to SSRF vulns

1. Spot features prone to SSRF vulns
- webhooks (learn what they are)
- file uploads
- proxy services
- link and thumbnails expansions 
- urls embedded in files and processed (XML, PDF)
- API endpoints that accept URLS
- website allow users to set up web hook urls
and this can lead to SSRF's

Notice these potentially vulnerable features on the target site and
record
Step 2: Provide Potentially Vulnerable Endpoints with Internal URLs

Step 3: Check the Results
- Get a domain from a SP that gives you logging access 
provide your domain in the SSRF payload and listen for 
out bound req to it through the server logs
- use netcat as a listener a
- outbound req isn't enough to exploit
- port scan the internal network for idiots(ports) that shouldn't be openned
but are openned

If you can identify a significant time
difference between requests to different ports, you have found an exploitable SSRF.
