Information Disclosure

Finding Your First Information Disclosure!
1. Look for software version numbers and configuration information by
using the recon techniques presented in Chapter 5.
2. Start searching for exposed configuration files, database files, and other
sensitive files uploaded to the production server that aren’t protected
properly. Techniques you can use include path traversal, scraping the
Wayback Machine or paste dump sites, and looking for files in exposed
.git directories.
3. Find information in the application’s public files, such as its HTML and
JavaScript source code, by grepping the file with keywords.
4. Consider the impact of the information you find before reporting it,
and explore ways to escalate its impact.
