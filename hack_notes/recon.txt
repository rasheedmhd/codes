5. Service Enumeration (port scanning)
- nmap, masscan
passive reconn
Shodan
Project Sonar
Censys
6. Crawl all pages - ZAP Spider
7. Third Party Hosting 
- Use google dorking to plus tools like lazys3
https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/
to discover open buckets, use aws cli to read the bucket contents
https://github.com/nahamsec/lazys3/ - I can rewrite it in Rust/Go/TypeScript
8. Github Recon - tools 
Gitrob (https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob/)
TruffleHog (https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog/) 
9. OSINT
10. Fingerprinting - 
- nmap domain_name -sV
- inspecting req headers in burp proxy
- view html sc  
tools - wapplyzer, builtwith, stackshare, retire.js
