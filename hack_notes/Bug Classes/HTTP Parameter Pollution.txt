HTTP Parameter Pollution
This happens when you send extra http url parameters to the servers to observe
how it handles them. 
You can send custom parameters or duplicate parameter value

HPP exists in two forms server and client side
server side - you send the server unexpected parameters to exploit
how it handles them
in the case of sending extra parameters, several server softwares 
handle that situation in different ways. In Recon and fingerprinting
you can make an educated guess on which server is used in the backend
so you can make an educated guess as to what will happen with the 
extra parameters you send.
Apache + PHP = last occurence 
Tomcat = first occurence
ASP + IIS = all occurences
