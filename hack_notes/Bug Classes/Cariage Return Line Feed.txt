CRLFs leads to 
HTTP request smuggling
- Adds another request to the initial legit request 
!= parameter pollution bc HPP duplicates req paramters != full requests
exploiting it can lead to 
cache poisoning, - modify app caches to arbitrary pages and 
return ilegit pages when the right pages are requested 
firewall by pass/evasion, 
request hijacking - stealing httponly cookies and HTTP
authentication information witbh no interaction between 
the attacker and client. 

HTTP response splitting
allows an attacker to split a single HTTP response by injecting new headers
that browsers interpret.
