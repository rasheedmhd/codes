Finding Your First SSO Bypass!
1. If the target application is using single sign-on, determine the SSO
mechanism in use.
2. If the application is using shared session cookies, try to steal session
cookies by using subdomain takeovers.
3. If the application uses a SAML-based SSO scheme, test whether the
server is verifying SAML signatures properly.
4. If the application uses OAuth, try to steal OAuth tokens by using open
redirects.
5. Submit your report about SSO bypass to the bug bounty program!
