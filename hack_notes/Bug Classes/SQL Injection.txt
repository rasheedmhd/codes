SQL Injection 
A SQL injection is an attack in
which the attacker executes arbitrary SQL
commands on an application’s database by supplying
malicious input inserted into a SQL statement.

Injecting Code into SQL Queries
A SQL injection attack occurs when an attacker is able to inject code into the
SQL statements that the target web application uses to access its database,
thereby executing whatever SQL code the attacker wishes.

SELECT Id FROM Users
WHERE Username='admin';-- ' AND Password='password123';
The -- sequence denotes the start of a SQL comment, which doesn’t get
interpreted as code, so by adding -- into the username part of the query,
the attacker effectively comments out the rest of the SQL query. The query
becomes this:
SELECT Id FROM Users WHERE Username='admin';

SELECT Title, Body FROM Emails
WHERE Username='vickie' AND AccessKey='ZB6w0YLjzvAVmp6zvr'
UNION SELECT 1,
CONVERT((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username="admin"), DATE);--

' or sleep(15) and 1=1#
' or sleep(15)#
' union select sleep(15),null#
