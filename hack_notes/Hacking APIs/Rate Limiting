A Note on Lax Rate Limits
Stay under the limit Rate, you can throttle your fuzzer's speed

Path By Pass
If you reach the rate limit for this request, try altering the URL path
with string terminators or various upper- and lowercase letters, like so:
POST /api/myprofile%00
POST /api/myprofile%20
POST /api/myProfile
POST /api/MyProfile
POST /api/my-profile

You might also
achieve the same result by including meaningless parameters in the path:
POST /api/myprofile?test=1

Origin Header Spoofing
Some API providers use headers to enforce rate limiting. 
X-Forwarded-For
X-Forwarded-Host
X-Host
X-Originating-IP
X-Remote-IP
X-Client-IP
X-Remote-Addr

Next, try either sending every possible origin header at once or including them in individual requests. 
API defenders may also include the UserAgent header
