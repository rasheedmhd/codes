Information Disclosure
======================
When an API and its supporting software share sensitive information
with unprivileged users

Often, you can gather the most information by interacting with an API
endpoint and analyzing the response

Broken Object Level Authorization
=================================
Accessing information you are not allowed to access. 
Similar to IDORs 

What is the hardest thing about bug bounty for beginners?

I am starting bug bounty this year and I am super focused on hitting $100k
What is one thing that you would say is the hardest thing to overcome to hit this goal?

Broken User Authentication
==========================
Any weakness within the API authentication process. 
These vulnerabilities typically occur when an API provider
either doesn’t implement an authentication protection mechanism or
implements a mechanism incorrectly.

Excessive Data Exposure
=======================
Excessive data exposure is when an API endpoint responds with 
more information than is needed to fulfill a request. 

Lack of Resources and Rate Limiting
===================================
When testing an API that is supposed to have rate limiting, the first thing
you should check is that rate limiting works, and you can do so by sending
a barrage of requests to the API. If rate limiting is functioning, you should
receive some sort of response informing you that you’re no longer able to
make additional requests, usually in the form of an HTTP 429 status code.

Broken Function Level Authorization
===================================
Broken function level authorization (BFLA) is a vulnerability where a user of
one role or group is able to access the API functionality of another role or
group

To discover BFLA, find admin API docs, send reqs as an unprivileged user that 
test admin functions and capabilities

403 Forbidden response from Access Controls 

If API docs for privileged actions is not available, discover or 
reverse engineer the endpoints used to perform privileged actions

Mass Assignment
===============
When an API consumer includes more parameters in
requests than the application intended and the application adds these
parameters to code variables or internal objects

Security Misconfigurations
==========================
All the mistakes developers could make within the supporting security 
configurations of an API. If a security misconfiguration is severe enough, 
it can lead to sensitive information exposure or a complete system takeover. 

Includes
Misconfigured headers, Transit encryption, 
Using default accounts eg admin:admin, 
Accepting unnecessary HTTP methods
No input sanitization, verbose error messaging


Injections
==========
Injection flaws exist when a request is passed to the API’s supporting infrastructure 
and the API provider doesn’t filter the input to remove unwanted
characters (a process known as input sanitization).
