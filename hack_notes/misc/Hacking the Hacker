Studying and working hard is often more valuable than being born innately intelligent 

If you wan to impress the world don't tear down the garage. Instead, build code that can withstand the hackers mauling axe.

Susan Bradley: let's tackle the fundamentals because technology is changing 
Mark Russinovich: Understand the system you are trying to defend from different viewpoints at an expert level.

CRYPTOGRAPHY 
It is the art of using maths(ciphers) and binary 1s and 0s (key) to encrypt or verify other digital content.

Cryptographic keys are usually 128 bits longer but if the maths is resistant to cipher attacks, the longest key is always 4096bits.

Symmetric Versus Asymmetric Keys:
If the key used to encrypt the content is the same key used to decrypt it: symmetric but if there is a different key used to decrypt the content it is Asymmetric:
Asymmetric is also known as public key cryptography which is used in the bitcoin blockchain 

Popular Cryptography
Symmetric Ciphers
- Data Encryption Standard(DES)
- Triple Data Encryption Standard( Tripple DES)
- Advanced Encryption Standard( AES)
Symmetric keys usually range from 128 to 256.Every bit increase  double the strength of the key within the same cipher.

Asymmetric Ciphers
- Diffie-Hellman 
- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
- Elliptical Curve Cryptography ( ECC )
Asymmetric key sizes usually range from 1024 to 4096. 
2048  is considered the bare minimum of Diffie-Hellman and RSA today.

ECC starts at 256 to 384 bits.
Asymmetric keys are used to encrypt Symmetric keys which do much of the encryption.

Hashes:
Cryptography is also used to verify identities and content.
In this scenario the plain text to be encrypted is applied to a key which returns a unique output known as the harsh. The content or identity can be reharsed
Again anytime to proof that the identity is not tampered with.

Common hashes include 
Secure Hash Algorithm 1, 2 ,3
1 and 2 have some Cryptographic weakness so 3 is recommended but the BITCOIN blockchain uses SHA-256


Cryptographic Uses:
- Password and biometric identity protection 
- Digital certification 
- HTTPS
- Verify downloaded Software 
- Email
- Protect harddrives and portable media
- Protect wireless networks 
- Credit card transactions 

Without Cryptography the internet would not be the internet and our computers would have never being under our control 

Cryptographic Attacks:
- Math attacks
- Known plaintext or cipher key
- Side channel attacks
- Insecure Implementation

FIREWALLS
Is a software or hardware security component designed to prevent unauthorized access between two or more security boundaries.

Early history of firewalls
What was later recognized as a firewall was created in 1987 by AT&T Bell Labs.

"The Packet filter: An efficient mechanism for User-level network code" by Jeffrey Mogul has the first mention of firewall technically.

Firewall Rules (policies)
The most common rule is to
Allow all outbound traffic and block all inbound traffic.

Where are firewalls?
Network based and Host based.

Advanced Firewalls.

What Firewalls protect against
- Remote buffer overflow attacks

PASSWORDS
Authentication Components
- Passwords
- Authentication datases
- Password hashes
(Windows: LANManager, PBKDF2, NTLANManager)
Linux(md5, blowfish, SHA-256 SHA-512)
Authentication challenges:
Secure network auth don't pass the password over the network link but performs an auth challenge and passes the answer over the internet for the client....bla..bla...bla...

Authentication factors:
2FA and MFA

Hacking passwords:
- Password Guessing 
- Phishing
- Keylogging 
- Hash cracking
- Credential reuse
- Hacking password reset portals

Password Defenses:
- Complexity and Length
12-character long or 16-character longer for privileged user accounts.
- Frequent Changes with No repeating 
- Not sharing password between systems
- Account lockout
- Strong password hashes (weak hashes includes LM hashes,SHA-1)
- Don't use passwords.
- Credential theft Def 
- Reset portal defense


WIRELESS 
Types of Wireless attacks
- Attacking access points
- Denial of service 
- Guessing the wireless channel password 
- Session hijacking 
- Stealing information 
- Locating user physically

Tools
- Wishark

- Kismet
- Fern
- Fire sheep

Wireless hacking Defenses:
- Frequency hoping
- Predefined client identification 
- Strong protocols (WPA over WEP)
- Long password (30 characters or more)
- Patching access points
- Electromagnetic shielding 

PENETRATION TESTING

Hacked a major TV network and Pornography.
"We even used cross-site scripting exploit to take over the entire cable company--from a single cable box"

LUARA CHAPELL:
First, learn Wireshark, of course! Just kidding … well, actually, I’m not kidding.
Wireshark is a perfect tool to use when you really want to understand how the network works, 
and it’s free! It is ranked #1 in security tools over at sectools.org for a reason.
(Seriously, it’s a lot more interesting to watch a TCP handshake than read about it in an RFC!) 

Secondly, learn TCP/IP really, really, really well. Take the time to capture your own traffic while you connect to a web server, 
send email, upload a file using FTP, etc.
As you are learning how the protocols work, watch the protocols using Wireshark.
Watch the TCP handshake, the request/reply nature of many applications, the connection teardown process, and more.

Thirdly, put together a simple attack lab. The computers don’t need to be big or fancy
just tie a few together with a switch and grab some of the free scanning/penetration testing tools available today.
Capture and analyze the traffic as you launch attacks on your other systems. 
Most of us are visual learners—being able to see an idle scan is way more interesting than just reading about it.
Network security is like a two-sided coin—you need to get a feel for how various attacks work in order 
to know how to defend against them. 

It’s a game.Playing problem-solving games is a great way to prime your brain for networking and security analysis.
