Think about this, I am reading https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/dos-via-cache-poisoning/
And he is caching bad resp causing a DOS. 

and I am thinking , dummy mean, I have had a gazillion errors in the past, and I have never thought about how to cache them.
THis is why I like  learning new things. bc if my arsenal is huge, I can draw patterns from a gazillion places
and connect the dots, but If I don't have this wide knowledge, I will only be cheating myself. 

THe more I learn, the more I know, the more I know, the more I can connect the dots. Getting clever bounties.
This is why I love this. Continual constant learnning, high risk, high reward.
