Stop aimlessly jumping from one program to another

select 3 explore them and choose only 1. 
Keep in mind of the attack surface. 
Ideally you want a program with a large attack surface, 
based on assets and vuln classes.

- What you hunt for should be driven by the platform. 
What vulns you look for should be based on the platform. 
If you do recon right, understand the target scope, you can make
an informed decision for what to test on what scope 

- Don't over complicate your setup
- Tools should make you more efficient not replace you
