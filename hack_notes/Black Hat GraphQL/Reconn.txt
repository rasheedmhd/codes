GraphQL Questions to Impact
===========================
Does the web server even have a GraphQL API? 
On which endpoint is GraphQL configured to receive queries? 

What implementation of GraphQL is running on the target server? 
What language is the GraphQL implementation written in? 
Is the implementation known to be vulnerable to certain attacks? 
What types of defenses exist for the specific GraphQL implementation? 
What are some of the out-of-the-box default configuration settings of this implementation? 
Does the GraphQL server have any additional security protection layers in place?

1 Detect GraphQL End point 
/v1/graphql
/v2/graphql
/v3/graphql

Additionally check for GUI end points 
/graphiql      /v1/graphiql       /v2/graphiql,
/playground    /v1/playground     /v2/playground

2 Detecting GraphQL
Manual guessing of possible graphql impl end points
Guessing usage of tools like graphiql 
Examples 
Apollo   -> TypeScript
Yoga

Graphene -> Python
Ariadne
Strawberry
Tartiflette

graphql-ruby -> Ruby
graphql-php  -> PHP
graphql-go   -> Go
graphql-java -> Java
Sangria      -> Scala
Juniper      -> Rust
HyperGraphQL -> Java

Graphene can expose two endpoints, one for GraphQL, and the other
for GraphiQL Explorer, which is built into Graphene
[
    app.add_url_rule('/graphql', view_func=GraphQLView.as_view(
        'graphql',
        schema=schema
    ))
    app.add_url_rule('/graphiql', view_func=GraphQLView.as_view(
        'graphiql',
        schema = schema,
        graphiql = True
    ))
]
Each endpoint could have different security settings.
One could be stricter than the other

$ curl -X GET http://localhost:5013/graphql
{"errors":[{"message":"Must provide query string."}]}

With this information, We automate a scan and
pick up any other GraphQL servers that may exist. 
- Detecting GraphQL end points with Nmap + http-grep NSE script
$ nmap -p 5013 -sV --script=http-grep --script-args='match="Must provide query string", 
http-grep.url="/graphql"' localhost

GraphQL servers could run on any port,
but a few are quite common, such as 
80–89, 443, 4000–4005, 8443, 8000, and 8080

Common Responses
This is basically comparing the return message with the nature of GraphQL responses 
"data": {
    #valid
    #query response information 
}

"errors": [{
    #invalid 
    #what went wrong 
}]

Identifying GraphQL without knowing any fields 
The __typename Field
query {
    __typename
}

When GraphQL servers accept queries using GET, you can pass the
query parameter along with the GraphQL query (in this case, the query{__typename}) 
 \With this in mind, 
we can automate the detection of GraphQL by using Nmap fairly easily. 
Example 
# nmap -p 5013 -sV --script=http-grep --script-args='match="__typename",
http-grep.url="/graphql?query=\{__typename\}"' localhost

If you have more than a handful of hosts to scan, you can use
Nmap’s -iL flag to point to a file that contains a list of hostnames, as
nmap -p 5013 -iL hosts.txt -sV ........

If the GraphQL server does not support GET-based queries, we can use
cURL and the __typename field to make a POST request to detect GraphQL

curl -X POST http://localhost:5013/graphql -d '{"query":"{__typename }"}'
-H "Content-Type: application/json"

List of Host, using bash 
for host in $(cat hosts.txt); do
    curl -X POST "$host" -d '{"query":"{__typename }"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
done

GraphW00f 
-d detect
-t target 
-f fingerprint 
$ python3 main.py -d -t http://localhost:5013

INTROSPECTION
one of the first things we want to test when we run into a
GraphQL application is whether its introspection mechanism is enabled.

Many GraphQL implementations enable introspection by default, 
Some might have an option to disable it, but others might not. 
Graphene does not provide the option to disable introspection. 
but graphql-php does

The State of Introspection in GraphQL Implementations
Language | Implementation | Introspection configuration |  Disable introspection option
---------|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------
Python    Graphene        Enabled by default            Not available
Python    Ariadne         Enabled by default            Available
PHP       graphql-php     Enabled by default            Available
Go        graphql-go      Enabled by default            Not available
Ruby      graphql-ruby    Enabled by default            Available
Java      graphql-java    Enabled by default            Not available

query IntrospectionQuery {
    __schema {
        queryType { name }
        mutationType { name }
        subscriptionType { name }
        types {
            kind
            name
            fields {
                name    
                args {
                    name
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Using nmap to detect when introspection is enabled
nmap --script=graphql-introspection -iL hosts.txt -sV -p 5013
