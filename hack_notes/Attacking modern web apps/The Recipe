Information gathering: Finding helpful information for the subsequent phases, such as the
applications installed and web server information:
 PTES: Intelligence gathering
 SP 800-115: Discovery (information gathering and scanning)
 WSTG: Information gathering, configuration, deployment management testing, and weak
cryptography for the system part (from Chapter 4)

Threat modeling: To understand which kind of attacks and vulnerabilities can be helpful
considering the application, its technical aspect, and the interest of a threat actor:
 PTES: Threat modeling
 WSTG: Threat modeling from Chapter 2, which considers the tests from Chapter 4
• Vulnerability analysis: We use testing techniques to identify and look at the vulnerabilities list:
 PTES: Vulnerability analysis.
 SP 800-115: Discovery (vulnerability analysis), looking for known vulnerabilities and using
the testing techniques (white, black, and gray boxes) to find new vulnerabilities.
 WSTG: In general, the entire process is both iterative and incremental. Understanding the
initial objectives derived from threat modeling and intelligence gathering begins. Typically,
we begin the process with an unauthenticated preliminary analysis, looking for low-hanging
fruits. Then, we continue with the complete tests/attacks.
• Exploitation: Where we can execute attacks and exploits. Once we are “in”, we have the
initial access.
 PTES: Exploitation.
 SP 800-115: Attack (gaining access). Successfully exploiting an application can sometimes
mean gaining access to an operating system. Often, the process is more complex.


Post-exploitation: When inside a system where we escalate our privileges and gain visibility, we
gather more information. If it aligns with our goals, we extract the data we need. This process
may further enable us to establish persistence or even initiate a pivot (a lateral movement). This
phase, in which we seek to understand the different paths attackers take, is where the MITRE
ATT&CK framework comes into play:
 PTES: Post-exploitation
 SP 800-115: Attack (gaining access)
