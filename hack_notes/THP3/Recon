Regular Nmap Diffing
For all our clients, one of the first things we do is set up different monitoring
scripts. These are usually just quick bash scripts that email us daily diffs of a
client's network.

Build a better network diff scanner:
Build a better port list than the default nmap (i.e. nmap default
misses ports like Redis 6379/6380 and others)
Implement nmap banners
Keep historical tracking of ports
Build email alerting/notification system

Finding Sub domains
Some servers do not respond by IP. They could be on shared
infrastructure and only respond by fully qualified domains. This is
very common to find on cloud infrastructure. So you can nmap all
day, but if you canâ€™t find the subdomain, you won't really know what
applications are behind that IP.
