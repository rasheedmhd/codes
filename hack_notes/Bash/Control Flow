In some operating systems, such as those often used in containers, the default shell
might not necessarily be bash. To account for these cases, you may want to use single
square brackets ([...]) rather than double to enclose your condition. This use of single brackets meets the Portable Operating System Interface standard and should work
on almost any Unix derivative, including Linux.
