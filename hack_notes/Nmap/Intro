nmap 
-h 
-sn ping scan 
-Pn host discovery process to check whether the target is online
-sn --traceroute include traceroute information 

execute an NSE script without port scanning our targets
-sn --script <dns-brute | broadcast-ping | etc>

Port Scanning 
Ports marked as open or filtered are of special interest as they represent
services running on the target host
nmap scanme.nmap.org 
• Open: Open indicates that a service is listening for connections on this port.
• Closed: Closed indicates that the probes were received, but it was concluded that
there was no service running on this port.
• Filtered: Filtered indicates that there were no signs that the probes were received
and the state could not be established. This could indicate that the probes are being
dropped by some kind of filtering.
• Unfiltered: Unfiltered indicates that the probes were received but a state could not
be established.
• Open/Filtered: This indicates that the port was filtered or open but the state could
not be established.
• Closed/Filtered: This indicates that the port was filtered or closed but the state
could not be established

nmap --dns-servers 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 scanme.nmap.org
-n to skip --dns-servers 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4

Scanning Specific Port Ranges
• Port list separated by commas: $ nmap -p80,443 localhost
• Port range denoted with hyphens: $ nmap -p1-100 localhost
• Alias for all ports from 1 to 65535: # nmap -p- localhost
• Specific ports by protocol: # nmap -pT:25,U:53 <target>
• Service name: # nmap -p smtp <target>
• Service name with wildcards: # nmap -p smtp* <target>
• Only ports registered in the Nmap services database: # nmap -p[1-65535] <target>

Selecting Network Interface
#nmap -e <interface> <target>
#nmap -e eth2 scanme.nmap.org

IP address ranges
nmap -p25,80 -O -T4 192.168.1.1/24 scanme.nmap.org/24

nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3 =  nmap 192.168.1.1-3
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.* : * = 1 - 255
Excluding hosts in ranges 
nmap 192.168.1.1-255 --exclude 192.168.1.1
or better pass a file
nmap --exclude-file dontscan.txt 192.168.1.1-255
